# This handbook

This handbook has it's source files at [github.com/openownership/bods-dev-handbook](https://github.com/openownership/bods-dev-handbook)

You can browse it at [openownership.github.io/bods-dev-handbook/](https://openownership.github.io/bods-dev-handbook/)

It will be in English only (no translations).

Currently, there is no requirement for pull requests to be made - you can edit content on the master branch directly if you want.
Later, that will change to a strict requirement to always use pull requests.

## Previewing work you have done

If you want to preview work before pushing it live, create a new branch in Git. Go to the GitHub UI, select the file you want to see and a preview is shown.

But be aware; there are some differences between this preview and the real docs on GitHub pages. These are:

### Links

If you just put a link in some text like this:

    Please go to http://example.com/

It will appear as a clickable link in the preview but NOT in github pages. To make the link clickable in Github pages, you must always use the bracket notation.

    Please go to [http://example.com/](http://example.com/)

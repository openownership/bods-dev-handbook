# Beneficial Ownership Data Standard - Development handbook

This repo contains work-in-progress documentation for people who are working *on* the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard. It is published on [github pages](https://openownership.github.io/bods-dev-handbook/) to keep it lightweight and easy to update.

To this repo you can add meta-documentation around updating the standard itself - workflows, processes, technical things and administrivia that you don't want to be siloed inside your own organisation's CRM or private wiki, but that don't need to be seen by people who are only publishing or consuming data which conforms to the standard. Do check to make sure what you want to add wouldn't be better suited to the docs of a particular tool.

If you add a new page, please list it on the contents below.
